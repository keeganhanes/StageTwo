# Course Project
This repository contains code for an interactive web app, created for the _Client-Side Web Development_ course at the UW iSchool.

The site can be viewed at <https://info340a-au18.github.io/project-keeganhanes/>

In order to use this interactive web app:
Use the data table! This is where most all of the functionality of the webpage is at the moment.
When first visiting the page the data is sorted by the parking lots with the greatest amount of available spots appearing first and those with the least amount of available spots last.
If you want to view the lots that have the greatest amount of handicap spots click the "handicap spots" button, if you would like to go back to viewing by most available spots, click the "available spots" button.
You can also search by street name. Type in a street such as "University Way" or "15th ave" (ignores case) and hit submit. The data table will then render lots on that street. You can also order this data by handicap spots and available spots by clicking their correlated buttons. If you would like to search for another street click the button with the refresh icon and type in a new street.
Lastly the data table lets you scroll through 5 pages worth of data by clicking the pagination at the bottom of the page. When you click any other buttons or search for a new street the pagination will reset itself to page one.
